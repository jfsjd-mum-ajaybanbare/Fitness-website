            <h2>WHAT IS PILATES</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Pilates is a form of training that focuses on using both mind and body to achieve optimum performance. The deep stabilizing muscles of the body are conditioned and strengthened using sequences of movements that use gravity, body weight and specially designed equipment as forms of resistance.

                Pilates is a well established training method of rebuilding strength and function following injuries. Since it is low impact it is ideal as a form of physical therapy; teaches you to consciously maintain optimum anatomical alignment in all positions and during movement, thus making you stronger and less liable to pain.
